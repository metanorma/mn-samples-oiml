== Scope and objectives

The scope of this Expert Report concerns guidance for preventing violations of measurements
and measurement data in instrumentation that is or that can be connected to a remote data
collection and control unit, and that is to be used for legal control.

It does not deal with acceptable intervention on the measurement result, nor does it deal with
incorrect interpretation of these results, and is restricted to violation of measurement results
only (both accidental and intentional).

The main objective is to provide guidance to OIML TCs/SCs on the decisions to be taken and
the options to consider in selecting and incorporating the necessary performance requirements
for the measurement devices and systems within the scope of this report.
