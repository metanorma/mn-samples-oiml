== Evaluation of metrologically relevant parts of measuring systems

Hardware, firmware and software protection measures are needed to satisfy the performance
requirements.

=== Hardware evaluation

==== Modular approach

When establishing the performance requirements and when performing tests on smart meters,
breaking these systems down into modules has the following advantages:

* a smart metering system in many cases already comprises a number of modules, the
configuration of which can easily differ;
* for some tests it is almost impossible to expose the smart metering system as a whole;
* when applying a modular approach the focus of the evaluation performance can be
restricted to only those modules which have an influence on the legal metrology
results.

A disadvantage is:

* practical results concerning the response of the system as a whole are not available
prior to the installation.

Performing tests on a system as a whole, however, would only be useful for testing the mutual
influence between devices installed at exactly the same distance from and orientation to each
other.

While these geometric parameters tend to be rather random, tests on mutual interference will
be very complex. A subdivision into modules combined with signal simulation is therefore
more appropriate.

* *Identifiable parts (instruments, devices or modules; whatever is applicable)*
+
--
To arrive at an overview for the purpose of setting requirements and performing tests, a
(smart) metering system can be considered as consisting of a combination of identifiable
parts.

For each of these parts the model below may be applied. Each part, stand-alone or as part of a
(measurement) system, can be considered as a black box with a number of input and output
ports.
--

* *Definition of an input or output port*
+
--
For the purpose of this Report, an input or output port of a device is considered as being each
physical channel through which a connection is or can be made between the electronic circuits
in this device and:

* another device; or
* a network; or
* the electromagnetic environment.

Such a connection may be established by making use of a physical product/medium (for
example a cable) or a physical phenomenon (wireless).
--

* *Kinds of ports*
+
--
A measurement device/module may comprise several ports having identical or different
functions. Such physical ports may be used for different purposes which may be sequential or
simultaneous and which make use of one and the same connection.

NOTE: The enclosure of a device is also to be considered as being an input and output port.

For example, distinction between the following kinds of ports may be made:

* (power) supply port;
* measurand input and output port;
* data transmission port;
* signaling and switching ports;
* enclosure port; and
* operator panel.

[[fig-1]]

--

* *Multi-function ports*
+
--
An example in which a port is used for more than one purpose is the connection of an
electrical energy meter to the mains power supply. In this case the wires are used for:

* transmission of the electrical energy;
* electrical energy supply to the energy meter;
* data transmission line.

Another subdivision could be made for data transmission, and one could even distinguish
between data transport and pulses mainly for switching purposes. The data transmission can
include the electrical energy meter measurement data.

Each of the input and output ports can potentially influence the measurement data.

Each type of port, on the one hand, has to withstand improper intervention and on the other
hand should not emit or produce a phenomenon to such a level that it leads to a disturbance on
one of the other ports.

NOTE: Emission of EM disturbances is generally not considered in legal metrology
requirements for measuring instruments.

When observing the different ports, the influence quantities listed below should be taken into
account.

*1 Power supply port*

The device will need to withstand or filter out the following disturbances from the power
supply port:

* mains voltage interruptions;
* mains voltage variations;
* mains voltage surges and bursts;
* all communication signals;
* induced radio frequency currents (antenna behavior).

*2 Measurand input port (analogue)*

The device will need to withstand or filter out the following potential disturbance from the
measurand input port:

* induced radio frequency currents (antenna behavior).

*3 Enclosure port*

The device will need to withstand or filter out the following potential disturbances from the
enclosure port:

* temperature/humidity fluctuations;
* electrostatic discharges;
* induced currents from radio frequency sources (antenna behavior);
* induced currents from power frequency sources including harmonics (near field
coupling).

*4 Data transmission port*

The device will need to withstand or filter out the following potential disturbances from the
data transmission port:

* data transmission line surges and bursts;
* out of band communication signals (signals for which the port is neither specified nor
reserved);
* out of band induced radio frequency currents (signals for which the port is neither
specified nor reserved).

*5 Operator port*

The device will need to withstand or filter out the following potential disturbances from the
operator port:

* electrostatic discharges;
* induced currents from radio frequency sources (antenna behavior);
* induced currents from power frequency sources including harmonics (near field
coupling).

==== Potential influences/disturbances and limitations

Generally speaking, influences or disturbances are the result of the presence of or change in
physical phenomena that influence the measurand, but not the measurand itself.

* *Spectrum of phenomena*
+
--
The behavior of the phenomena can be quite diverse. The values of the climatic parameters
generally do not change as fast as the electromagnetic phenomena.

Also, the nature of these physical phenomena can be quite diverse. For example some are
only one-dimensional such as temperature, humidity and air pressure while others are multidimensional,
such as vibration and electromagnetic phenomena. Another parameter which has
to be taken into account and which differs quite a lot between phenomena is the dwell time.

This difference in behavior will influence the risk on the measurand; the risk assessment
approach should therefore be fitted to this behavior.

* *Actual coverage by performance requirements*
+
--
Over the past 20-30 years, performance requirements for measuring instruments that are
exposed to influences and disturbances on the enclosure port have been implemented in
OIML Recommendations for a number of phenomena. Influences on the measurand (internal,
external) have been taken into account, but the actual risk of such disturbances in most cases
has not been addressed.

For phenomena having a long or medium term dwell time this risk can easily be estimated. It
has more or less already been taken into account by specifying the rated operating conditions.

For short and ultra-short dwell times the risk cannot easily be estimated, but in general the
appropriate requirements and test levels are copied from generic IEC standards and are based
on experiences on interference in practice. Therefore, these levels should implicitly take into
account the risk of interference.

For some phenomena (see below) no performance requirements have yet been specified. One
could assume that disturbances as a consequence of these will be covered by the general
performance requirements of the measuring device. The risk of a disturbance, however, will
be unknown when the dwell time of the phenomenon is short and its existence is location
dependent.

* *Low frequency phenomena*
+
--
As can be seen from Table 2 for a number of relatively low frequency conducted and radiated
phenomena, standards are not available and/or standardization is in progress. Caution is
therefore advised and it may be necessary to develop and perform product specific tests.
--

* *Mutual interference of instruments in the same vicinity*
+
--
One should be aware that the levels for EMC immunity testing as specified in generic IEC
standards do not cover the risk of mutual interference between adjacent instrumentation.

It could be expected that manufacturers in such cases will notice any undesirable behavior
during prototyping. But this approach would not cover the potential interference from a
device from some other manufacturer, which for example would be the case when power line
communication is also in use next to the smart meter data communication line.
--

* *Estimating the level of interference from radiating sources*
+
--
When attempting to estimate the level of electromagnetic interference, the following
parameters need to be assigned a value:

* expected environment of operation;
* level of immunity of the measuring instrument.

Both tend to be complex but considerable research has been carried out and studies provide
some figures on expected maximum levels of emission of sources.

When determining the properties of the environment, all contributing sources and distances
from these sources are to be taken into account.

When determining the expected level of immunity, a mathematical model could be used or
immunity tests could be performed. Both could be rather complex.

Simple but adequate models and/or reproducible test setups should be created.

One approach could be to base the deduced level of interference on the maximum expected
emissions and optimal coupling between the sources and the "victim". The outcome of such
an approach would probably be that some (perhaps most) of the instrumentation would not be
in conformity with the requirements for non-interference.

Another approach could be to include a risk analysis, taking into account both the actual risk
when a potential source is present, and the coupling factor. This factor would comprise e.g.
distance, polarity and isotropy components, each of which contributes to the resulting
intensity on the victim location.

Such an analysis can be performed using a mathematical model, but setting up such a model
requires additional work. A Monte Carlo approach could probably be the best technique to
estimate the risk.
--

* *Coverage of immunity tests*
+
--
Over the past ten years an exponential increase in the use of the electromagnetic spectrum has
been observed, mainly for communication purposes. This accounts for both transmission line
bound and free space phenomena.

Driven by commercial incentives the telecommunication companies have optimized the use of
the limited available EM bandwidth by using sophisticated and intelligent software methods.

This increase in use, however, has not kept pace with the limited bandwidth available and the
techniques for exploiting the upper RF bandwidth regions; therefore, the potential risk of
conflicting use of the spectrum is increasing.

For decades, standardization committees have been intensively working on preventing mutual
interference by setting requirements on emission and susceptibility of (mainly) electronic
devices.

Their first focus on EM interference originated from the prevention of disturbance of radio
services.

Besides this prevention of evident interference risks on communication, standardization of
EM interference-related qualities further arose from hazardous incidents and commercial
pressures.

However, since the occurrence of an interference in many cases is stochastic in nature,
protective measures and standardization of these measures have only been implemented in
those cases where there is a relatively high risk of occurrence and where there are substantial
consequences.

A review of the agreed measures as specified in standards over the whole EM spectrum shows
that this process has lead to an incomplete coverage of EM interference protective measures,
resulting in certain gaps in specific bands.

The introduction of smart metering has made these gaps in protection more manifest.

One gap which has become more prominent concerns the VLF and LF band protection. Due
to the fact that in this band below 150 kHz no (efficient) radio transmissions are operated,
there is no real concern and therefore no involvement of radio protection agencies in this
band. The use of EM phenomena and signals in this band is merely transmission line bound
and emissions to free space are beneath the level of observance (noise level) within a few
meters of the transmission line.

Electricity suppliers and distributors make use of this frequency band for switching and
signaling over mains power lines. Since instrumentation connected to the mains will in
general frequently be exposed to such signaling and since its properties are well defined, the
risk of unexpected interference will already become prominent at the design stage of such
instruments, and can be reduced prior to marketing the product.

Of more concern are those mains connected products which produce disturbances in this
frequency band and whose waveforms are more or less arbitrary pulses. Smart meters, when
directly connected to these mains power supplies, can suffer from these kinds of signals, not
only as a result of the interference on the measurand but also on the measured data when
using PLT/PLC as a means of communicating this data.

No adequate measurement methods or standardization are applicable for these kinds of
interferences.

.Overview of the electromagnetic spectrum in use for radio and infrared communication

Frequency bands in use for smart metering are:

* VLF and LF (conducted) band for PLC;
* UHF band (radiated) for GPRS.

=== Software/firmware evaluation

==== Modular approach

Unlike hardware evaluation, the software evaluation of a complete smart metering system as a
whole would in most cases be an impossible task.

A modular approach is the only practical way of evaluating software.

In principle, the constituent parts of the system are to be evaluated and data in an insecure
environment is to be protected. Refer to OIML D 31 for such an evaluation.

==== Potential influences/disturbances and limitations

The need to evaluate the parts of the system depends on the location of the primary registers
in which the results of measurement quantities and the associated time intervals are stored.
The need to evaluate data transmission securing measures will depend on this location.

Furthermore, the smart metering software/firmware should include the securing of adequate
time recording which, in turn, implies accurate time-stamping and interval measurement
which are of sufficient resolution.

Time measurement can be performed to a very high degree of accuracy when using up-to-date
techniques. In principle, this should not limit the accuracy in establishing the overall result of
the measurements, but attention has to be paid to synchronizing and to avoiding delays as a
consequence of processing and transmission. The securing of the synchronizing method and
means shall be such that the accuracy of the time measurement has no consequences on the
overall measurement result.
