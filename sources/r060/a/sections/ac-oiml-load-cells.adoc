=== Tests

The determination of the measurement error, the stability of the dead load output,
repeatability and creep in the temperature range of stem:[-10 "unitsml(degC)"] to
stem:[+40 "unitsml(degC)"] as well as the tests of barometric pressure effects and
the determination of the effects of damp heat steady state have been performed according
to OIML R 60 as shown in <<table-C2>> on the load cell denominated in the test report
with the reference No. xxx, dated xxx.

=== Description of the load cell

====
The load cells (LC) of the series xxx are double bending beam load cells. They are
made of aluminium, and the strain gauge application is hermetically sealed. Further
essential characteristics are given in the data sheet (see the section "6 Data sheet
and dimensions" in this Annex).

[[sec-C.6]]
=== Further information

The manufacturing process, material and sealing (i.e., environmental protection)
of the produced load cells shall be in accordance with the tested patterns; essential
changes shall be identified and communicated to the issuing authority and are only
allowed with the permission of the issuing authority based on the impact of those
changes on the certification process.

Sufficient information shall be included to describe the patent design.

The typical errors related to linearity, hysteresis and temperature coefficient as
indicated in the data sheet point out possible single errors of a pattern; however,
the overall error of each pattern is determined by the maximum permissible error
according OIML R 60-1, 5.3.2.

The technical data, the dimensions of the load cell and the principle of load transmission
are given in section 6 of this Annex, "Data sheet and dimensions", and shall be complied with.
