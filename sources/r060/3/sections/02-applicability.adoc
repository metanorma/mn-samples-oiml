== Applicability of this Report Format

In the framework of OIML B 18 _Framework for the OIML Certification System (OIML-CS)_
[6] applicable to load cells in conformity with OIML R 60-1 and R 60-2, use of this
Report Format is mandatory, in French and/or in English with translation into the
national languages of the countries issuing such certificates, if appropriate.

Implementation of this Report Format is informative with regard to the implementation
of OIML R 60-1 and R 60-2 in national regulations.

=== Calculation procedures

==== {blank}

In order to facilitate a comparison of the reports established in English and in
French, the same abbreviations (those of the English language) are used in both versions;
the meanings of these abbreviations are given whenever appropriate.

In testing and evaluating load cells for type evaluation, it is recognised that the
test apparatus and practices used by the various laboratories will be different.
OIML R 60 allows for these variations and still provides a method for testing, recording
and calculating results that are readily understandable by other knowledgeable parties
reviewing the data.

In order to achieve this ease of comparability it is necessary that those persons
conducting the tests use a common system for recording data and calculating results.

Thus, it is essential that the calculation procedures below be reviewed and followed
closely in the completion of this test report.

[[sec-2.1.2]]
==== Load cell errors (stem:[E_L =] Error Load test)

===== {blank}

Complete a <<table-6.3>> for each test temperature, calculate the averages and record
in the right-hand column. When five runs are necessary, use <<table-6.4>>.

===== {blank}

Determine the conversion factor, stem:[f], which is the number of indicated units
per load cell verification interval, stem:[v], and is used to convert all
"indicated units" to "stem:[v]". It is determined from the test data averages of
the increasing load tests at the initial stem:[20 "unitsml(degC)"] nominal test temperature.

===== {blank}

If a test load corresponding to 75 % of the measuring range for the load cell under
test (i.e. stem:[2250] divisions for a stem:[3000] division cell, which is stem:[D_{"min"}]
plus 75 % of the difference between stem:[D_{"max"}] and stem:[D_{"min"}]) is not
included in the test loads used in <<table-6.3>>, interpolate between the adjacent
upper and lower values of the averages of all three test runs and record in <<table-6.5>>
(see R 60-2, 2.8.2).

[[sec-2.1.2.4]]
===== {blank}

Calculate the difference between the average indication on the increasing load test
runs at 75 % of the difference between stem:[D_{"max"}] and stem:[D_{"min"}] and
the indication at stem:[D_{"min"}]. Divide the result (to five significant figures)
by the number of verification intervals (75 % of stem:[n]) for that load to obtain
the conversion factor, stem:[f], and record in the tables that follow.

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
f = {"average indication at" quad 0.75 cdot (D_{"max"} - D_{"min"}) -
"indication at" quad D_{"min"}} / {0.75 cdot n}
++++

The units of conversion factor, stem:[f], are indicated units (e.g. digits or counts)
per load cell verification interval, stem:[v].

===== {blank}

Enter the average test indications of the tests at the temperatures following the
initial test at a nominal stem:[20 "unitsml(degC)"] in <<table-6.5>>. In recording
this data, indicate a "no test load" indication (at stem:[D_{"min"}]) as "0".
This may require subtracting the "no load indication at stem:[D_{"min"}]" from the
"test load indication" so that the first entry in the column is "0". These "0's"
have been preprinted on the form to clarify that a dead load condition is recorded
as "0".

===== {blank}

Calculate the reference indication, stem:[R_{"i"}], by converting the net test load,
in mass units, to indicated units (e.g. counts or digits), by multiplying by the
conversion factor, stem:[f], for each test load and recording in the 2nd column in
<<table-6.5>>.

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
R_i = {("test load" quad i - D_{"min"})} / {(D_{"max"} - D_{"min"})} cdot n cdot f
++++

===== {blank}

In <<table-6.5>> calculate the difference between the average test indication and
the reference indication for each test load at each test temperature and divide the
result by the conversion factor, stem:[f], to obtain the error, stem:[E_{"L"}], for
each test load in terms of stem:[v].

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
E_L = ("average test indication for test load" quad i - "reference indication" quad R_i) // f
++++

===== {blank}

Compare stem:[E_{"L"}] with the corresponding MPE for each test load.

==== Repeatability error (stem:[E_R] in terms of verification interval, stem:[v])

===== {blank}

Enter data in <<table-6.6>>.

===== {blank}

Calculate the maximum difference between the test indications on <<form-6.3,Form 6.3>>
and divide it by stem:[f] to obtain the repeatability error, stem:[E_{"R"}], in terms
of the load cell verification interval, stem:[v].

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
E_R = ("maximum indication of the test load" - "minimum indication") // f
++++

===== {blank}

Compare stem:[E_{"R"}] with the absolute value of the corresponding MPE for each
test load.

==== Temperature effects on minimum dead load output (MDLO) (stem:[C_M =] Change MDLO)

===== {blank}

Enter in <<table-6.7>> the average indication for the initial minimum test load,
stem:[D_{"min"}], for each test temperature from <<table-6.3>>.

===== {blank}

Calculate the difference between the average test indications for each temperature
stem:[T_{"i"}] in sequence and divide the result by the conversion factor, stem:[f],
to obtain the change in terms of the load cell verification interval, stem:[v].

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C_{"M"} = ("average test indication at" quad T_2 - "average indication at" quad T_1) // f
++++

===== {blank}

Divide stem:[C_{"M"}] by (stem:[T_2 - T_1]) and multiply the result by a factor
stem:[T_{"f"} = 5] for class B, C, and D load cells or stem:[T_{"f"} = 2] for class
A load cells. This gives the change in stem:[v] per stem:[5 "unitsml(degC)"] for
class B, C, and D load cells or in stem:[v] per stem:[2 "unitsml(degC)"] for class
A load cells.

===== {blank}

Multiply the result by stem:[[(D_{"max"} - D_{"min"}) // n // v_{"min"}]] to give
the final result stem:[C_{"M"}( v_{"min"})] in units of stem:[v_{"min"}] per
stem:[5 "unitsml(degC)"] for class B, C, and D load cells, or in units of stem:[v_{"min"}]
per stem:[2 "unitsml(degC)"] for class A load cells. stem:[C_{"M"}(v_{"min"})] must
not exceed stem:[p_{"LC"}].

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
bb(C_M(v_{"min"}) = | {C_M cdot T_f}/{(T_2 - T_1)} xx {(D_{"max"} - D_{"min"})} / {n cdot v_{"min"}} |)

==== Creep magnitude stem:[C_C(t)] and minimum dead load output return (stem:[C_{"DR"}])

(stem:[C_C(t) =] Creep, expressed in terms of the load cell verification interval, stem:[v])

(stem:[C_DR = DR], expressed in terms of the load cell verification interval, stem:[v])

Remark: Contrary to the minimum dead load output return stem:[DR] in terms of mass
the minimum dead load output stem:[C_DR] is expressed in terms of the verification
interval, stem:[v].

From the test indications recorded in <<table-6.8>>, calculate the difference between
the initial indication obtained at the minimum creep test load after the stabilisation
period and any indication obtained over the 30 minute test period with the maximum
creep test load of 90 % to 100 % of stem:[E_{"max"}] and divide by the conversion
factor, stem:[f].

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C_C (t) = ("indication" - "initial indication") // f
++++

Remark: If the minimum creep test load or the maximum creep test load differ from
stem:[D_{"min"}] or stem:[D_{"max"}] according to <<sec-2.1.2>> "Load cell errors
stem:[E_{"L"}]" the conversion factor, stem:[f], must be recalculated with the minimum
and maximum creep test loads (see <<sec-2.1.2.4>>).

test load after the stabilisation period (stem:[t_0 = 0 "unitsml(min)"]) and the
indication at the minimum creep test load after the creep test and after a time interval

factor, stem:[f], to obtain the minimum dead load output return, stem:[C_{"DR"}],
in terms of stem:[v].

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C_{"DR"} = ("minimum test load indication"2 - "minimum test load indication"1) // f
++++

===== {blank}

If the time intervals specified in R 60-2, Table 1 have been met, stem:[C_{"DR"}]
must not exceed 0.5 stem:[v].

===== {blank}

If the actual time is between 100 % and 150 % of the specified time in
R 60-2, Table 1, then the following applies:

[stem%unnumbered]
++++
C_{"DR"} <=  0.5 (1 - (x - 1)) v
++++

[align=center]
stem:[x =] actual time/specified time

===== {blank}

Whereas stem:[C_{"DR"}] expresses the minimum dead load output return in terms of
stem:[v], the value of stem:[DR] as used in OIML R 76 [1] is expressed in units of
mass (stem:["unitsml(g)"], stem:["unitsml(kg)"] or stem:["unitsml(t)"]).

===== {blank}

Calculate the minimum dead load output return, stem:[DR], expressed in units of mass
(stem:["unitsml(g)"], stem:["unitsml(kg)"] or stem:["unitsml(t)"]) as follows:

Regardless of the value declared by the manufacturer for the apportionment factor,
stem:[p_{"LC"}], the MPE for creep shall be determined from R 60-1, Table 4 using
the apportionment factor, stem:[p_{"LC"} = 0.7] (see R 60-1, 5.5.1).

(stem:[C_{"Hmax"} =] Change due to Humidity effect on the indication of the maximum
test load stem:[D_{"max"}])

Remark: If the minimum or maximum test load used for this test differ from the minimum
test load stem:[D_{"min"}] or maximum test load stem:[D_{"max"}] according to
R 60-3, 2.1.2 "Load cell errors stem:[E_{"L"}]" the conversion factor, stem:[f],
