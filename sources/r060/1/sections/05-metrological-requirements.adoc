== Metrological requirements

=== Principle of load cell classification

The classification of load cells into specific accuracy classes is provided to facilitate
their application to various measuring systems. In the application of this Recommendation,
it should be recognised that the effective performance of a particular load cell
may be improved by compensation means within the measuring system with which it is
applied. Therefore, it is not the intention of this Recommendation to require that
a load cell be of the same accuracy class as the measuring system in which it may
be applied. Nor does it require that a measuring instrument, indicating in units
of mass for example, use a load cell which has been approved during a separate type
evaluation. All data/items found in <<sec-5.1.1;to!sec-5.1.7>> shall be specified
by the manufacturer.

[[sec-5.1.1]]
==== Accuracy classes and their symbols

Load cells shall be ranked according to their overall performance capabilities into
one of the four accuracy classes whose designations are as follows:

Class A; Class B; Class C; Class D.

[[sec-5.1.2]]
==== Maximum number of load cell verification intervals

The maximum number of load cell verification intervals, stem:[n_{"LC"}], into which
the maximum measuring range stem:[E_{"max"} - E_{"min"}] (see <<sec-3.5.8>>) can
be divided in a measuring system shall be within the limits presented in <<table-1>>.

|===
| | Class A | Class B | Class C | Class D
<| Lower limit | stem:[50000] | stem:[5000]   | stem:[500]   | stem:[100]
<| Upper limit | Unlimited    | stem:[100000] | stem:[10000] | stem:[1000]
|===

==== Minimum load cell verification interval

The minimum load cell verification interval, stem:[v_{"min"}], shall be specified
by the manufacturer (see <<sec-3.5.11>> in combination with <<sec-3.5.15>>).

[[sec-5.1.4]]
==== Supplementary classifications

Load cells shall also be classified by the intended manner in which a load is applied
to the load cell wherever there would be a risk of confusing the manner of loading
(i.e. compression loading, tension loading or universal). A load cell may bear different
classifications according to the intended manner in which a load is applied to the
load cell. The manner of loading for which the classification(s) applies(y) shall
be specified. For multiple capacity load cells, each capacity shall be classified
separately.

[[sec-5.1.5]]
==== Complete load cell classification

The load cell shall be classified corresponding to the following six parameters:

. accuracy class designation (see <<sec-5.1.1>> and <<sec-6.2.4.1>>);

. maximum number of load cell verification intervals (see <<sec-5.1.2>> and <<sec-6.2.4.5>>);

. intended manner of the application of the load, if necessary (see <<sec-5.1.4>> and <<sec-6.2.4.2>>);

. special limits of working temperature, if applicable (see <<sec-6.2.4.3>>);

. humidity symbol, if applicable (see <<sec-6.2.4.4>>); and

. additional characterisation information, as listed below in <<fig-4;and!sec-5.1.6;and!sec-5.1.7>>.

An example illustrating the six parts of the load cell classification is shown in <<fig-4>>.

==== Standard classification

Standard classifications shall be used; examples are shown in <<table-2>>.

| C2 NH       | Class C, stem:[2000] intervals, not to be subjected to humidity test
|===

[[sec-5.1.7]]
==== Multiple classifications

Load cells that have comprehensive classifications for the manner in which the load
is applied to the load cell shall be accompanied by the relative information for
each classification. An example is shown in <<table-3>>. An illustration of the standard
classification symbols, using an example, is shown in <<fig-4>>.

| C3 ↑ ↓ - 5/30 | Class C, 3 000 intervals, tension, stem:[-5 "unitsml(degC)"] to stem:[+30 "unitsml(degC)"]
|===

=== Measuring ranges

==== Minimum load of the measuring range (stem:[D_{"min"}]) (see <<sec-3.5.12>>)

The value of the smallest load applied to a load cell during test which is expressed
in units of mass shall not be less than stem:[E_{"min"}] (see <<sec-3.5.9>>).

==== Maximum load of the measuring range (stem:[D_{"max"}]) (see <<sec-3.5.6>>)

The value of the largest load applied to a load cell during test which is expressed
in units of mass shall not be greater than stem:[E_{"max"}] (see <<sec-3.5.5>>).

[[sec-5.3]]
=== Maximum permissible measurement errors

Under the rated operating conditions in <<sec-5.6>>, the maximum permissible error
(MPE) shall not exceed the values stated in <<sec-5.5>>.

The MPE is applicable after increasing as well as decreasing the force applied
(i.e. they include hysteresis).

==== Maximum permissible errors for each accuracy class

The maximum permissible measurement errors for each accuracy class are related to
the maximum number of load cell verification intervals (stem:[n_{"LC"}]) specified
for the load cell (see <<sec-5.1.2>>) and to the actual value of the load cell verification
interval, stem:[v].

[[sec-5.3.2]]
==== Type evaluation

The MPE (see <<sec-3.7.10>>) on type evaluation shall be the values derived using
the expressions contained in the left column of <<table-4>>. The apportioning factor,
stem:[p_{"LC"}] shall be chosen and declared (if other than 0.7) by the manufacturer
and shall be in the range of 0.3 to 0.8: (stem:[0.3 <= p_{"LC"} <= 0.8])
footnote:[Associated with apportionment of error provisions contained within OIML
R 76-1, 3.5.1 and 3.10.2.1 [1\]; R 50-1, 2.2.33.2.2 [24\]; R 51-1, 5.2.3.4 [25\];

cell is applied to such instruments.], where "m" is the value (expressed in mass)
representing the force introduced by the load applied.

|===

The value of the apportioning factor, stem:[p_{"LC"}] shall appear on the OIML certificate,
if the value is not equal to 0.7. If the apportioning factor, stem:[p_{"LC"}] is
not specified on the certificate then the value 0.7 shall be assumed. The maximum
permissible error may be positive or negative and is applicable to both increasing
and decreasing loads.

The limits of error shown include errors due to non-linearity, hysteresis and temperature
effect on sensitivity over certain temperature ranges, specified in <<sec-5.6.1.1>>
and <<sec-5.6.1.2>>. Further errors, not included in the <<table-4>> limits of error,
are treated separately.

=== Repeatability error

The maximum difference between the results of five identical load applications for
classes A and B and of three identical load applications for classes C and D shall
not be greater than the absolute value of the MPE for that load.

[[sec-5.5]]
=== Permissible variation of results under reference conditions

[[sec-5.5.1]]
==== Creep

The difference between the reading taken upon the application of a maximum load (stem:[D_{"max"}])
and the reading observed within and after 30 minutes of exposure of 90 % to 100 %
of stem:[E_{"max"}] shall not exceed 0.7 times the absolute value of MPE for the
applied load.

Regardless of any value declared by the manufacturer for the apportioning factor,
stem:[p_{"LC"}], the MPE for creep shall be determined from stem:[table-4] using
the apportioning factor, stem:[p_{"LC"} = 0.7].

The difference in readings taken after 20 minutes of exposure to 90 % to 100 % of
stem:[E_{"max"}] and at 30 minutes of exposure to 90 % to 100 % of stem:[E_{"max"}]
shall not exceed 0.15 times the absolute value of MPE.

====

==== Minimum dead load output return (DR) (see <<sec-3.5.10>>)

The difference between the initial reading of the minimum load output (stem:[D_{"min"}])
and the reading of stem:[D_{"min"}] at the conclusion of the creep test (<<sec-5.5.1>>),
shall not exceed half the value of the load cell verification interval
(stem:[0.5 " v"]).

NOTE: It should be noted that DR is the minimum dead load output return expressed
in mass units (g, kg, t). DR has to be adjusted in a value expressed in load cell
verification intervals, v.

[[sec-5.6]]
=== Influence quantities (Rated operating conditions)

Load cells shall be evaluated under the conditions specified in <<sec-5.6.1;to!sec-5.6.3>>.
An evaluation may include additional special testing performed under conditions that
vary from those specified in <<sec-5.6.1;to!sec-5.6.3>> if requested and specified
by the applicant submitting the load cell for evaluation. This special testing may
be performed in addition to, but not instead of testing under the specified conditions
in <<sec-5.6.1;to!sec-5.6.3>>.

Load cells that are equipped with functions typically performed by complete instruments
may be required to be evaluated against additional requirements contained in other
OIML Recommendations for those complete instruments. These additional evaluations
are outside the scope of this Recommendation (see <<sec-2.3;and!fig-2>>).

[[sec-5.6.1]]
==== Temperature

[[sec-5.6.1.1]]
===== Temperature limits

Excluding temperature effects on minimum dead load output, the load cell shall perform
within the limits of error in <<sec-5.3.2>> over the temperature range of
stem:[-10 "unitsml(degC)"] to stem:[+40 "unitsml(degC)"], unless otherwise specified
as in <<sec-5.6.1.2>>.

NOTE: National legislation may prescribe alternative temperature limits outside of
the range specified above as appropriate for local climatic conditions and the environmental
conditions that can be anticipated.

[[sec-5.6.1.2]]
===== Special limits

Load cells for which particular limits of working temperature are specified shall
satisfy, within those ranges, the conditions defined in <<sec-5.3.2>>. The span of
these ranges shall be at least:

[css text-indent:12.5mm]#stem:[5 "unitsml(degC)"] for load cells of class A;# +
[css text-indent:12.5mm]#stem:[15 "unitsml(degC)"] for load cells of class B;# +
[css text-indent:12.5mm]#stem:[30 "unitsml(degC)"] for load cells of classes C and D.#

===== Temperature effect on minimum dead load output

The minimum dead load output of the load cell over the temperature range, as specified
in <<sec-5.6.1.1>> or <<sec-5.6.1.2>>, shall not vary by an amount greater than the
apportioning factor, stem:[p_{"LC"}], times the minimum load cell verification interval,
stem:[v_{"min"}], for any change in ambient temperature of:

[css text-indent:12.5mm]#stem:[2 "unitsml(degC)"] for load cells of class A;# +
[css text-indent:12.5mm]#stem:[5 "unitsml(degC)"] for load cells of class B, C and D.#

==== Barometric pressure

The output of the load cell shall not vary by an amount greater than the minimum
load cell verification interval, stem:[v_{"min"}], for any incremental change in
barometric pressure equivalent to stem:[1 "unitsml(kPa)"].

[[sec-5.6.3]]
==== Humidity

With respect to humidity conditions, this Recommendation defines 3 humidity classes:
CH (cyclic humidity - as standard), NH (no humidity), and SH (steady-state humidity).
In the case of class NH or SH, the class designation shall be marked on the load
cell. In the case of class CH, class designation marking of the load cell is not
mandatory.

===== Humidity error - CH or unmarked load cells

This requirement is only applicable to load cells marked CH or with no humidity symbol
marking and not applicable to load cells marked NH or SH.

The influence of exposure to temperature cycles specified in R 60-2, 2.10.5.12 on
the load cell output for minimum load shall not be greater than 4 % of the difference
between the output on the maximum capacity, stem:[E_{"max"}], and that at the minimum
dead load, stem:[E_{"min"}].

The influence of exposure to temperature cycles specified in R 60-2, 2.10.5.12 on
the load cell output for the maximum load shall not be greater than the load cell
verification interval, v.

===== Humidity error - SH marked load cells

This requirement is only applicable to load cells marked SH and is not applicable
to load cells marked NH or CH or with no humidity symbol marking.

A load cell shall meet the MPE applicable to the load applied as specified in <<table-4>>,
when exposed to conditions of relative humidity variations as specified in R 60-2, 2.10.6.11.

=== Requirements for analogue-active and digital load cells

[[sec-5.7.1]]
==== General requirements

In addition to the other requirements of this Recommendation, analogue-active load
cells shall comply with the following requirements. The MPE shall be determined using
an apportioning factor, stem:[p_{"LC"}] greater than or equal to 0.7 and less than
or equal to 0.8 (stem:[0.7 <= p_{"LC"} <= 0.8]) substituted for the apportioning
factor, stem:[p_{"LC"}], that is declared by the manufacturer and applied to the
other requirements.

If a digital load cell equipped with further data processing (<<sec-3.1.3.4>>) is
configured with substantial additional electronic functions (e.g. display of indications,
frequency counter) that are typical of an electronic weighing instrument, it may
be considered outside the scope of this Recommendation and the load cell may need
to undergo additional evaluation against requirements contained in other OIML Recommendations
which are applicable to weighing instruments.

[[sec-5.7.1.1]]
===== Faults

An analogue-active load cell shall be designed and manufactured such that when it
is exposed to electrical disturbances either:

. [[item-5.7.1.1-a]]significant faults do not occur; or
. [[item-5.7.1.1-b]]significant faults are detected and acted upon.

If significant faults do occur, and the load cell is equipped with the intelligence
to detect and act upon significant faults through the instrument that the load cell
is installed in, the reporting of and acting upon significant faults would then be
evaluated under the appropriate Recommendation for the complete instrument.

Messages of significant faults should not be confused with other messages presented.

NOTE: A fault in value that is equal to or smaller than the load cell minimum verification
interval, stem:[v_{"min"}], is allowed.

[[sec-5.7.1.2]]
===== Acting upon significant faults

When a significant fault has been detected, either the load cell shall be made inoperative
automatically or a fault detection output shall be issued automatically. This fault
detection output shall continue until the fault has been resolved.

[[sec-5.7.1.3]]
===== Durability

The load cell shall be suitably durable so that the requirements of this Recommendation
may be met in accordance with the intended use of the load cell.

===== Compliance with requirements

An analogue-active load cell is presumed to comply with the requirements in <<sec-5.7.1.1;and!sec-5.7.1.3>>, if it passes the examinations specified in <<sec-5.7.2>> and R 60-2, 2.10.7.

===== Application of the requirements in <<sec-5.7.1.1>>

The requirements in <<sec-5.7.1.1>> may be applied separately to each individual
cause or significant fault. The choice of whether <<item-5.7.1.1-a>> or <<item-5.7.1.1-b>>
is applied is left to the manufacturer.

[[sec-5.7.2]]
==== Influence quantities

===== Warm-up time

During the designed warm-up time of an analogue-active load cell there shall be no
transmission of measurement results.

===== Mains power supply (AC)

An analogue-active load cell that operates from a mains power supply shall be designed
to comply with the metrological requirements if the mains power supply varies in
voltage from -15 % to +10 % of the supply voltage.

===== Battery power supply (DC)

An analogue-active load cell that operates from a battery power supply shall either
continue to function correctly, or not provide a measurement result whenever the
voltage is below the value specified by the manufacturer.

===== Maximum allowable variations during voltage variations

All functions shall operate as designed.

All measurement results shall be within maximum permissible errors.

===== Disturbances

When an analogue-active load cell is subjected to the disturbances specified in
R 60-2, 2.10.7.5 to 2.10.7.10 (also summarised in <<table-5>>), the difference between
the load cell output due to a disturbance and the load cell output without disturbance
(fault) shall satisfy the conditions in <<sec-5.7.1.1>>.

===== Span stability: maximum allowable variation requirements (not applicable to class A load cells)

When an analogue-active load cell is subjected to the span stability test specified
in R 60-2, 2.10.7.11, the variation in the load cell span measurement results shall
not exceed the greater of: half the load cell verification interval; or half the
absolute value of the MPE for the applied test load stem:[D_{"max"}].
