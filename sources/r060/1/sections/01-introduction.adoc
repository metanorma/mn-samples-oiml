== Introduction

Load cells comprise a distinct element or module within other complex instruments;
they do not produce distinct quantitative values that are inherently identified or
associated with denominations or units. The data that can be extracted from a load
cell is simply a measurement of change in the output of the load cell in relation
to the input. This relative change must be converted by other elements or modules
within an instrument into values that are meaningful measurements which can then
be used to identify a quantity.

Although strain gauge technology was a primary focus in the initial development of
R 60, it is to be understood that load cells that operate using other principles
may also be evaluated under this Recommendation.
