This Recommendation prescribes the principal metrological static requirements and
static evaluation procedures for load cells used in the determination of conformity
to this Recommendation. It is intended to provide authorities with uniform means
for determining the metrological characteristics of load cells used in measuring
instruments that are subjected to metrological controls.

It is acknowledged that test procedures found in OIML R 60-2 are useful in the evaluation
of load cells that are currently in service (i.e. primarily of the strain gauge design)
however, there may be variations in designs for load cells that will require additional
or modified test procedures to appropriately evaluate them. These additional test
procedures may be annexed when necessary.

Except where otherwise specified, these requirements apply regardless of the technology
or operating principle employed. The requirements and evaluation procedures in this
Recommendation have been drafted to be non-specific with regard to load cell design
and their operating principles.

This Recommendation utilises the principle that several measurement errors shall
be considered together when applying load cell performance characteristics to the
permitted error envelope. Thus, it is not considered appropriate to specify individual
errors for given characteristics (e.g. non-linearity, hysteresis, effects of influence
factors), but rather to consider the total error envelope allowed for a load cell
as the limiting factor. The use of an error envelope allows the balancing of the
individual contributions to the total error of measurement while still achieving
the intended final result.

NOTE: The error envelope may be defined as the boundary of the combined individual
errors (see <<table-4>>) as a function of the force introduced by the applied load
(expressed in mass units) over the measuring range. The combined error determined
may be positive or negative and include the effects of non-linearity, hysteresis
and temperature.

"Weighing modules" as noted in OIML R 76 [1], T.2.2.7 (see R 60, Annex A, A.2.1),
are not covered by this Recommendation. Weighing instruments that include load cells
and which give an indication of mass are the subjects of separate Recommendations.
While digital load cells may be covered under this Recommendation, a load cell that
produces an output consisting of more than digital "raw counts" is not covered.
In the illustration from OIML R 76 below, the scope of R 60 would not extend beyond
module #3.
