== Technical requirements

=== Software

Provision shall be made for appropriate sealing by mechanical, electronic and/or
cryptographic means, making any change that affects the metrological integrity of
the device impossible or evident. Any embedded programming (i.e. firmware) that influences
the raw count output of the load cell will be evaluated under the terms of this Recommendation.
In addition, if the software modifies load cell performance, not exceeding the functions
of analogue to digital conversion and the linearization of the load cell output,
then that software shall be evaluated under the terms in this Recommendation and
in accordance with OIML D 31 [8]. Any weighing instrument function shall be evaluated
under other appropriate Recommendations for weighing instruments.

Functionality of any software which is not covered by this Recommendation, e.g. functionalities
of weighing instruments, is outside the scope of this Recommendation and is therefore
not evaluated. It may be required to undergo additional evaluations against other
requirements contained in the applicable OIML Recommendations for weighing instruments.

The requirements which are relevant to the evaluation of load cells and provided
in OIML D 31 [8] shall be fulfilled for the load cell by taking into account the
following aspects.

. In general, for load cells, the severity level I, examined with validation procedure
A, is required.

. For legally relevant software of digital load cells the following statements according
to OIML D 31 [8] shall be applied.

. The exception described in OIML D 31, 5.1.1 [8] for an imprint of the software
identification is allowed.

. The level of conformity of manufactured devices to the approved type is according
to OIML D 31, 5.2.5 (subclause a) [8].

. Updating the legally relevant software of a load cell in the field is possible
via verified or traced update according to OIML D 31, 5.2.6.2 and 5.2.6.3 [8].

. The software documentation shall include descriptions according to the applicable
requirements of OIML D 31, 6.1.1 [8].

The validation procedures are described in OIML D 31, 6.4 [8].

=== Inscriptions and presentation of load cell information

Technical information markings including load cell classifications as indicated in
<<sec-5.1.5>> must be specified for the load cell(s).

=== Mandatory markings on the load cell

The following mandatory markings shall be clearly and indelibly marked on the load
cell. When a sticker or data plate is used it shall be impossible to remove them
without damaging them.

. Manufacturer's name or trade mark

. Manufacturer's type designation or load cell model

. Serial number

. Maximum capacity as: stem:[E_{"max"} = "(in units g, kg, t)"]

. Year of production

. Type approval mark (if applicable)

If due to the limitation of the size of the load cell, it is impossible to apply
all the mandatory markings, the manufacturer's name or trade mark, the load cell
type designation, the serial number, and the maximum capacity shall be provided as
a minimum on the load cell itself. All other mandatory information shall be provided
in an accompanying document supplied by the manufacturer and submitted to the user.
Where such a document is provided, the information required in <<sec-6.2.2>> shall
also be given therein.

[[sec-6.2.2]]
==== Mandatory additional information

The following mandatory information shall be provided in a document accompanying
the load cell supplied by the manufacturer and submitted to the user or, if space
permits, they may be marked on the load cell. Where the information provided is associated
with a specific unit of measure, the unit (g, kg, t) shall also be specified.

. Manufacturer's name or trade mark

. Manufacturer's type designation or load cell model

. Accuracy class(es); see <<sec-6.2.4.1>>

. Type of load; see <<sec-6.2.4.2>>

. Working temperature when required; see <<sec-6.2.4.3>>

. Humidity symbol when required; see <<sec-6.2.4.4>>

. Maximum capacity as: stem:[E_{"max"} =]

. Minimum dead load as: stem:[E_{"min"} =]

. Safe load limit as: stem:[E_{"lim"} =]

. Minimum load cell verification interval as stem:[v_{"min"}] (or relative minimum
load cell verification interval, stem:[Y]) =

. Value of the apportioning factor, stem:[p_{"LC"}], if not equal to 0.7; and

. Other pertinent conditions that must be observed to obtain the specified performance
(for example, electrical characteristics of the load cell such as output rating,
input impedance, supply voltage, cable details, mounting torque, etc.).

==== Non-mandatory additional information

In addition to the information required in <<sec-6.2.2>>, the following information
may optionally be specified:

. for a weighing instrument (for example a multiple range instrument according to
OIML R 76 [1]), the relative stem:[v_{"min"}], stem:[Y], where
stem:[Y = (E_{"max"} - E_{"min"}) // v_{"min"}] (see <<sec-3.5.15>>);

. for a weighing instrument (for example a multi-interval instrument according to
OIML R 76) [1], the relative DR, Z, where
stem:[Z = (E_{"max"} - E_{"min"}) // (2 xx DR)] (see <<sec-3.5.14>>) and the value
of DR (see <<sec-3.5.10>>) is set at the maximum permissible minimum dead load output
return according to R 60-2, 2.10.1;

. other information considered necessary or useful by the manufacturer.

==== Specific markings

[[sec-6.2.4.1]]
===== Accuracy class designation

Class A load cells shall be designated by the character "A", class B by "B",
class C by "C" and class D by the character "D".

[[sec-6.2.4.2]]
===== Designation of the type of load applied to the load cell

The designation of the type of load applied to the load cell shall be specified when
it is not clearly apparent from the load cell construction, using the symbols shown
in <<table-6>>.

[[table-6]]
.Symbols for different types of load transmission principles
[cols="2"]
