==== Imposition of controls

This Recommendation prescribes performance requirements for load cells used in devices
or systems subjected to legal metrological control. National legislation may impose
metrological controls that verify compliance with this Recommendation. Such controls,
when imposed, may include type evaluation.

[[sec-1.2]]
=== Measurement standards

The expanded uncertainty, stem:[U] (for coverage factor stem:[k = 2]), for the combination
of the force-generating system and the indicating instrument used during the tests
to observe the load cell output shall be less than 1/3 times the MPE of the load
cell under test [OIML G 1-100 _Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement_] [7].
