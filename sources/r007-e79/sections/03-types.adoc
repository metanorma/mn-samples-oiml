== Types

=== {blank}
The clinical thermometers (mercury-in-glass, with maximum device) covered by this
Recommendation may be either of the solid-stem type or the enclosed-scale type.

==== {blank}
In the case of a solid-stem thermometer, the scale is marked directly on the stem.

==== {blank}
In the case of an enclosed-scale thermometer, the scale is marked on a "scalebearing
strip" fixed longitudinally behind the capillary tube. The capillary tube and the scale-bearing
strip are enclosed in a transparent, sealed tube fused to the bulb and forming a protective
sheath.

=== {blank}
The thermometers must include a maximum device which prevents the mercury column
from receding solely because of the cooling of the thermometer.
