== Field of application

The provisions of this Recommendation apply to those thermometers called "clinical
thermometers", of the mercury-in-glass type, with a maximum device, intended for
measurement of the internal human body temperature.

This Recommendation does not apply to special purpose thermometers (thermometers for
premature babies, ovulation thermometers), which owing to their measurement range, scale
interval or maximum permissible error, do not meet the following requirements.

These special purpose thermometers, as well as thermometers for veterinary applications,
could subsequently be made the subject of additions to this Recommendation.
