== Policy

Travel expenses incurred by the CIML President in attending legal metrology related events to which
they have been invited to represent the OIML may be paid or reimbursed by the BIML. Attendance at a
legal metrology related event includes meetings of regional metrology organisations, legal metrology
organisations, and international organisations (in liaison with the OIML), normally with the intention of
providing a report / presentation (e.g. about current activities of the OIML).

Where the CIML President is unable to attend a legal metrology related event to which they have been
invited, this policy will apply to the person nominated by the CIML President to attend on their behalf.

Travel by the CIML President will follow the guidelines listed below.

NOTE: This policy does not cover travel undertaken by the CIML President when attending an
International Conference on Legal Metrology, a CIML meeting, or a Presidential Council
meeting.
