== Foreword

The International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) is a worldwide, intergovernmental organisation whose
primary aim is to harmonise the regulations and metrological controls applied by the national metrological
services, or related organisations, of its Member States. The main categories of OIML publications are:

* *International Recommendations (OIML R)*, which are model regulations that establish the
metrological characteristics required of certain measuring instruments and which specify methods and
equipment for checking their conformity. OIML Member States shall implement these Recommendations
to the greatest possible extent;

* *International Documents (OIML D)*, which are informative in nature and which are intended to
harmonise and improve work in the field of legal metrology;

* *International Guides (OIML G)*, which are also informative in nature and which are intended to give
guidelines for the application of certain requirements to legal metrology; and

* *International Basic Publications (OIML B)*, which define the operating rules of the various OIML
structures and systems.

OIML Draft Recommendations, Documents and Guides are developed by Project Groups linked to Technical
Committees or Subcommittees which comprise representatives from OIML Member States. Certain international
and regional institutions also participate on a consultation basis. Cooperative agreements have been established
between the OIML and certain institutions, such as ISO and the IEC, with the objective of avoiding contradictory
requirements. Consequently, manufacturers and users of measuring instruments, test laboratories, etc. may
simultaneously apply OIML publications and those of other institutions.

International Recommendations, Documents, Guides and Basic Publications are published in English (E) and
translated into French (F) and are subject to periodic revision.

Additionally, the OIML publishes or participates in the publication of *Vocabularies (OIML V)* and periodically
commissions legal metrology experts to write *Expert Reports (OIML E)*. Expert Reports are intended to provide
information and advice, and are written solely from the viewpoint of their author, without the involvement of a
Technical Committee or Subcommittee, nor that of the CIML. Thus, they do not necessarily represent the views
of the OIML.

This publication -- reference OIML B 22:2023 (E) -- was developed by the BIML. It was approved for final
publication by the International Committee of Legal Metrology at its 58th meeting in October 2023.
