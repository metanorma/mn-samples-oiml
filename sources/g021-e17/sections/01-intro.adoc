== Introduction

Prepackages can give rise to concerns on the part of consumers regarding the quantity of product they
contain. These concerns are usually addressed by specifying product requirements in a normative
document such as an OIML Recommendation. The packer of the prepackage should then demonstrate
that the quantity of product in the prepackage complies with the prescriptions in the OIML
Recommendation. In certain cases it might be sufficient for the packer to assess and declare
conformity, but in other cases a national authority might require that conformity be assessed by a
competent and impartial third party.
