== Design and application of marks of conformity

[[cls-E.1]]
=== Application of the mark of conformity

==== {blank}
Once a packer is certified by a designated body it may apply the applicable mark of
conformity, together with the unique identification number or code allocated to the designated body.

[[cls-E.1.2]]
==== {blank}
Should any of the following occur, a packer should immediately cease to apply the mark to
prepackages:

. the certificate of the packer is withdrawn by the designated body; or
. the designation of the certification body is suspended or withdrawn; or
. the packer no longer produces prepackages or a specific range of prepackages according
to the stated requirements.

NOTE: Application of the mark of conformity may be subject to national legislation in the country in
which the prepackages are sold.

NOTE: Prepackages produced prior to the certification of the packer becoming invalid for the
reasons mentioned in <<cls-E.1.2>> may be found in the market for some time after such withdrawal.

Identification of packer

A prepackage that carries the mark of conformity should carry an identification of the packer, either:

. the packer's full name and physical address; or
. an anonymous code assigned by the certification body (see also <<cls-D.3>> for codes assigned
on certificates).

=== Design of the mark of conformity (example)

==== {blank}
The mark of conformity may consist of:

. either a logo of the designated body or a logo defined by the designating body;
. a unique identification of the designated body; and
. where the name and address of the packer does not appear on the prepackage, the
unique identification code (see <<cls-E.1>>) should also appear within the mark.

==== {blank}
The format of the marks may be as defined in drawings <<fig-E.2.2.1;and!fig-E.2.2.2>>.

==== {blank}
The minimum height of figures and characters in the mark should be stem:[3 "unitsml(mm)"].
