== Example of test procedures for the verification of measuring systems

This Annex describes examples of typical verification procedures using pipe provers. It should be noted
that there are many other applicable test methods described in OIML Recommendations and ISO
Standards. All verification procedures should comply with the provisions of this Document.

[[cls-A.1]]
=== Test procedure for measuring systems for liquid fuel

Two typical installations, in which a pipe prover and a measuring system for liquid fuel are connected,
are shown in <<fig-8;and!fig-9>>. The basic test procedure for these systems is as follows:

. Carry out a sufficient number of preliminary runs.
. Locate the displacer at the starting position, reset the pulse counter and interval timer.
. Start the displacer in movement. Ensure that both the pulse counter and the interval timer start
when the start detector is activated.
. While counting pulses, read and record the temperature and pressure of the pipe prover and the
measuring system.
. Check that both the pulse counter and the interval timer stop when the end detector is activated.
. Read and record the indicated results of the pulse counter and the interval timer.

=== Test procedure for measuring systems for LPG under pressure

A typical installation, in which a measuring system for LPG under pressure is tested using a pipe prover,
is shown in <<fig-10>>. It should be ensured that the LPG remains in liquid phase inside the pipe prover
by means of an appropriate device, if necessary. The basic test procedure shall be the same as those
described in <<cls-A.1>>.

=== Test procedure for LPG dispensers

A typical installation, in which a full-stroke type pipe prover is used for verifying an LPG dispenser, is
shown in <<fig-11>>. The basic test procedure is as follows:

. Locate the pipe prover horizontally and close to the dispenser (to make the pipework as short as
possible).
. Connect the outlet nozzle of the dispenser to the inlet of the twin-type 3-way valve connected to
the pipe prover.
. Position the 3-way valve to initiate the flow. Purge gas adequately and conduct preliminary runs.
Check that no air bubbles are present by means of a sight glass.
. Locate the displacer at the starting position and reset the indication of the dispenser.
. Start the cylindrical piston movement.
. Read and record the temperature, pressure and flowrate of the liquid during flow.
. Read and record the volume displayed on the dispenser when the displacer reaches the end point of
its stroke.
