== Scope

This Document covers provers, including piston provers, which are used as standards to verify and/or
calibrate measuring equipment/systems for volume or for measuring the flowrate of liquids. These
processes for verification/calibration are conducted in compliance with the metrological requirements
in the relevant OIML Recommendations or other international standards. This Document proposes
model technical requirements for the design, installation, calibration, and use of provers in legal
metrology and in industries involved in flow and volume measurements.
